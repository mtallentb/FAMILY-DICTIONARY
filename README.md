## Instructions

1. Define a hash that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.
    ```
    my_family = {
        :sister => {
            :name => 'Krista',
            :age => 42
        },
        :mother => {
            :name => 'Cathie',
            :age => 70
        }
    }
    ```
2. Using array methods, produce output that looks like the following example.
    ```
    Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
    ```
